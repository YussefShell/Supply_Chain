# Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an advanced, in-depth analysis of supply chain data using SQL queries. The analysis aims to optimize various components of the supply chain, such as financial performance, product quality, logistics efficiency, and supplier management. By leveraging the insights from the data, the goal is to enhance decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and drive profitability.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Integrity and Quality Control**: Ensure that data used in decision-making is accurate and reliable. Identify any missing, incomplete, or incorrect data to maintain high data quality.
2. **SKU-Level Performance Insights**: Evaluate the performance of individual SKUs to inform inventory management and product line decisions.
3. **Logistics and Transportation Optimization**: Analyze transportation modes and routes to minimize shipping costs and reduce lead times.
4. **Supplier Performance Analysis**: Evaluate supplier performance based on key metrics such as costs, defect rates, revenue generation, and lead times.
5. **Revenue and Cost Analysis by Product Type**: Understand the financial performance of different product types, focusing on profitability.
6. **Profitability by Supplier**: Identify the most and least profitable suppliers by analyzing revenue and cost data.
7. **Product Quality and Defect Rate Insights**: Identify areas where product quality is lacking by analyzing defect rates across different product types, suppliers, and inspection results.
8. **Logistics Cost Management**: Analyze and optimize logistics costs by evaluating transportation modes and shipping routes.
9. **Supplier Lead Times and Production Volume Analysis**: Evaluate supplier lead times and production volumes to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
10. **Comprehensive Financial Reporting**: Generate a financial report that provides a holistic view of costs, revenue, and profits by product type and supplier.

## SQL Queries

### Data Integrity and Quality Control
The project starts by identifying missing or incomplete data across key fields such as:
- Product Type
- Price
- Availability
- Lead Times
- Inspection Results

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT SKU
FROM supply_chain
WHERE Product_type IS NULL OR
      Price IS NULL OR
      Availability IS NULL OR
      Stock_levels IS NULL OR
      Lead_times IS NULL OR
      Defect_rates IS NULL;
```

### SKU-Level Performance Insights
Analyzing the number of items sold and total revenue generated per SKU to understand which products drive the most value.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT SKU, SUM(Number_of_products_sold) AS Total_Sales, SUM(Revenue_generated) AS Total_Revenue
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY SKU
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

### Logistics and Transportation Optimization
Optimization of logistics by analyzing the transportation modes and routes that incur the highest costs or cause delays.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT Transportation_modes, AVG(Shipping_costs) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY Transportation_modes
ORDER BY Avg_Shipping_Cost DESC;
```

### Supplier Performance Analysis
Evaluating suppliers based on financial performance (total costs, revenues, and profits) and defect rates. This analysis helps to identify high-performing and underperforming suppliers.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT Supplier_name, SUM(Revenue_generated) AS Total_Revenue, SUM(Costs + Manufacturing_costs) AS Total_Cost, 
       (SUM(Revenue_generated) - SUM(Costs + Manufacturing_costs)) AS Profit
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY Supplier_name
ORDER BY Profit DESC;
```

### Revenue and Cost Analysis by Product Type
Determine the most profitable product types by comparing total revenue and costs associated with each product.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
WITH RevenueData AS (
    SELECT Product_type, SUM(Revenue_generated) AS Total_Revenue
    FROM supply_chain
    GROUP BY Product_type
), CostData AS (
    SELECT Product_type, SUM(Costs + Manufacturing_costs) AS Total_Cost
    FROM supply_chain
    GROUP BY Product_type
)
SELECT R.Product_type, R.Total_Revenue, C.Total_Cost, (R.Total_Revenue - C.Total_Cost) AS Profit
FROM RevenueData R
JOIN CostData C ON R.Product_type = C.Product_type
ORDER BY Profit DESC;
```

### Product Quality and Defect Rate Insights
Analysis of defect rates by product type and supplier, to identify any quality issues that need to be addressed.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT Product_type, Supplier_name, AVG(Defect_rates) AS Avg_Defect_Rate
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY Product_type, Supplier_name
ORDER BY Avg_Defect_Rate DESC;
```

### Logistics Cost Management
Managing logistics costs by analyzing the costs associated with different transportation modes and routes.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT Routes, AVG(Shipping_costs) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY Routes
ORDER BY Avg_Shipping_Cost DESC;
```

### Supplier Lead Times and Production Volume Analysis
Identify suppliers causing delays by analyzing their average lead times and production volumes.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT Supplier_name, AVG(Lead_times) AS Avg_Lead_Time, AVG(Production_volumes) AS Avg_Production_Volume
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY Supplier_name
ORDER BY Avg_Lead_Time ASC;
```

### Comprehensive Financial Reporting
The project concludes with a detailed financial report that aggregates revenue, costs, and profits for each product type and supplier.

SQL Query Example:
```sql
WITH CostData AS (
    SELECT Product_type, SUM(Costs + Manufacturing_costs) AS Total_Cost
    FROM supply_chain
    GROUP BY Product_type
), RevenueData AS (
    SELECT Product_type, SUM(Revenue_generated) AS Total_Revenue
    FROM supply_chain
    GROUP BY Product_type
)
SELECT C.Product_type, C.Total_Cost, R.Total_Revenue, (R.Total_Revenue - C.Total_Cost) AS Profit
FROM CostData C
JOIN RevenueData R ON C.Product_type = R.Product_type
ORDER BY Profit DESC;
```

## Benefits of This Analysis

1. **Improved Decision Making**: Accurate data on product sales, costs, and supplier performance leads to better decision-making on product portfolios, supplier contracts, and logistics strategies.
2. **Logistics Efficiency**: By analyzing transportation modes and routes, the company can reduce shipping costs and lead times, improving both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
3. **Supplier Management**: Identifying suppliers with high defect rates or long lead times allows the company to address quality issues and optimize the supply chain.
4. **Financial Optimization**: A clear understanding of costs and revenue per product type and supplier enables the company to maximize profitability through targeted cost-cutting and pricing strategies.

## Conclusion

This project provides a deep, comprehensive analysis of the supply chain using SQL, with an emphasis on financial performance, quality control, supplier management, and logistics optimization. The insights derived from the data will guide business strategies that improve profitability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
