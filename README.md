Advanced Supply Chain Analysis SQL Project
Overview
This project presents an in-depth SQL-based exploration of supply chain data, aimed at extracting detailed insights to enhance operational efficiencies and decision-making in supply chain management. It utilizes a series of sophisticated SQL queries to probe into product performance, supply chain integrity, cost management, and supplier evaluation.

Project Objectives
Data Integrity Assurance: Conduct rigorous checks to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data by identifying null or erroneous entries across critical fields, thus preparing the dataset for reliable analysis.
SKU Rationalization: Aggregate SKU data to identify trends and anomalies, supporting inventory optimization and SKU rationalization strategies.
Product Performance Metrics: Deep dive into product-specific performance, analyzing sales, revenue generation, and demographic engagement to pinpoint high-performing products and categories.
Cost and Supplier Analysis: Evaluate supplier contribution to the supply chain, analyzing aspects such as defect rates, costs, and revenue contributions to identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize supplier relationships.
Logistics Optimization: Assess the efficiency and cost implications of various transportation modes and routing decisions to streamline logistics and reduce overhead costs.
Detailed Features and Benefits
Data Validation and Cleansing
Comprehensive Null Checks: Identify incomplete records across all dimensions, ensuring robust datasets for analysis. This prevents skewed results and supports accurate forecasting and planning.
Data Type Validation: Ensure that all data fields adhere to their expected formats, crucial for accurate sorting, filtering, and calculation operations.
Analytical Queries
Product and Sales Analysis:
Product Popularity and Sales Trends: Analyze sales data grouped by product types to uncover popular items and customer preferences.
Revenue and Cost Analysis: Calculate total and average revenues, alongside detailed cost analysis, to derive net profitability by product type, aiding in financial planning and budgeting.
Supplier and Manufacturing Insights:
Defect Rate Analysis: Identify defect trends by supplier and product type to pinpoint quality control issues.
Cost Efficiency Evaluation: Analyze supplier costs, including direct and manufacturing costs, to assess supplier efficiency and impact on the overall cost structure.
Logistics and Transportation Analysis:
Transportation Cost Assessment: Evaluate the financial impact of different transportation modes on supply chain costs, facilitating more cost-effective transportation planning.
Route Efficiency: Investigate route-specific costs to optimize routing decisions and enhance delivery efficiency.
Operational Benefits
Enhanced Decision-Making: By providing detailed analytics on various aspects of the supply chain, stakeholders can make informed decisions that reduce costs, enhance supplier performance, and optimize product portfolios.
Risk Mitigation: Early identification of data inconsistencies and potential quality issues helps in proactive risk management and mitigation strategies.
